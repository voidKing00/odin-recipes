    <h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h2>

    <p>"Best steak ever," raves TxLady2. "I can't believe how good such a cheap cut could be. I'm not a fan of wine, red especially, so I used someone's suggestion to substitute balsamic vinegar and Worcestershire sauce instead."</p>

    <p>"Your recipe is very aptly named," says Margo Crane. "This was hands-down the most fantabulous steak I have ever eaten!! The marinade was delicious and the meat almost melted in my mouth, it was so tender."</p>

    <p>"Great recipe," according to CookinKate. "I made it per instructions, except I used all dried spices and I marinated the steak overnight. This is definitely the BEST version of flat iron steak I've ever made."</p>
